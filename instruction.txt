Build a simple, intuitive digital catalog / price list web app designed for small businesses (e.g. food vendors, service providers).
The goal is to clearly display items and prices and allow users to quickly interact without creating accounts.

Core Requirements (MVP)
General

The app should be mobile-first, responsive, and fast.

No user authentication is required for customers.

Each visitor should be automatically assigned a unique anonymous user ID, stored in localStorage if it does not already exist.

Landing Page

Display:

Brand name / business name

A grid view of all available items

Items should be grouped by categories

Provide a tab-based navigation to switch between categories

Include a search bar:

Search should work across all categories

If a result is outside the current category, indicate the category name in the result

Item Card

Each item card should display:

Image

Name

Price

Two actions:

Add to Favourite

Send to Chat (WhatsApp)

Item Detail View

Clicking an item opens a modal

Modal should show:

Full description

Price

Multiple images (if available)

Same action buttons

Favourite System:

When a user clicks “Add to Favourite”:

Save the item ID to the user’s localStorage

Persist the favourite in the database using:

item ID

anonymous user ID

This data will later be used for business insights

WhatsApp Integration

“Send to Chat” should open WhatsApp using Click-to-Chat

Use a pre-filled message template:

Hi, I found interest in this item: {{item_name}}
{{item_image}}


Send to a predefined company WhatsApp number stored in environment variables

Admin Section

Admin access should be protected using credentials stored in environment variables

Admin capabilities:

Add items

Update items

Delete items

Upload images

Admin should also have a Favourites Insight Page:

View favourited items

Group favourites by anonymous user ID

Show count of favourites per item

Tech Stack Constraints:

MongoDB for database

Cloudinary for image uploads

Environment variables for:

Admin username

Admin password

WhatsApp number

No third-party authentication required

Design Philosophy

Prioritize clarity over complexity

Avoid unnecessary features

Each screen should solve one clear problem
